    Adapter bridging dependency-injector containers with CQRS framework.

    This adapter enables seamless integration between the dependency-injector library
    and the CQRS framework by providing type-based dependency resolution for request
    and event handlers. It automatically discovers all providers in the container
    hierarchy and builds an internal mapping that enables efficient resolution.

    Key Features:
        - Automatic provider discovery through recursive container traversal
        - Type-based resolution without manual registration
        - Support for nested container hierarchies
        - Two-strategy resolution: exact type match and inheritance-based matching
        - Performance optimization through caching
        - Clean state management when re-attaching containers

    Resolution Strategies:
        1. Exact Match: Directly resolves registered concrete types
        2. Inheritance Match: Resolves abstract interfaces by finding their concrete implementations
           (This enables Dependency Inversion Principle - depend on abstractions, not concretions)

    Usage Pattern:
        >>> from dependency_injector import containers, providers
        >>>
        >>> # Define your dependency-injector container
        >>> class Container(containers.DeclarativeContainer):
        ...     database = providers.Singleton(Database)
        ...     user_repository = providers.Factory(UserRepository, db=database)
        ...     user_service = providers.Factory(UserService, repo=user_repository)
        >>>
        >>> # Attach to CQRS framework
        >>> cqrs_container = DependencyInjectorCQRSContainer()
        >>> cqrs_container.attach_external_container(Container())
        >>>
        >>> # Resolve dependencies by type in your handlers
        >>> service = await cqrs_container.resolve(UserService)
        >>> # Or resolve by abstract interface

        Attach an external dependency-injector container and build type-to-provider mappings.

        This method performs three critical operations:
        1. Stores a reference to the external container
        2. Recursively traverses the entire container hierarchy to discover all providers
        3. Builds an internal map from types to their provider access paths

        The traversal process examines all providers in the container, including those
        in nested sub-containers, and records the dotted path to reach each provider.
        This enables efficient type-based lookup during resolution.

        Args:
            container: A configured dependency-injector container instance (typically
                a DeclarativeContainer subclass with providers defined as class attributes).

        Behavior on Multiple Calls:
            If called multiple times, this method completely resets the internal state:
            - Clears the previous type-to-provider mapping
            - Clears the provider lookup cache
            - Rebuilds mappings from the new container
            This allows hot-swapping containers but invalidates any previous resolutions.

        Example:
            >>> class Container(containers.DeclarativeContainer):

        Resolve and instantiate a dependency by its type.

        This is the primary method for obtaining dependencies in CQRS handlers.
        It uses a two-strategy approach to find the appropriate provider and
        then invokes it to create or retrieve an instance.

        Resolution Strategies (executed in order):
            1. Exact Type Match:
               Searches for a provider explicitly registered for the requested type.
               Example: resolve(UserService) finds providers.Factory(UserService, ...)

            2. Inheritance-Based Match:
               If no exact match exists, searches for a provider registered for a
               subclass of the requested type. This enables resolving abstract base
               classes or interfaces to their concrete implementations.
               Example: resolve(IUserService) finds providers.Factory(UserService, ...)
                        where UserService implements IUserService

        Args:
            type_: The type/class to resolve. Can be either a concrete class or an
                abstract base class/interface.

        Returns:
            An instance of the requested type. The instance lifecycle (singleton,
            factory, etc.) is determined by the provider configuration in the
            external container.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If no provider can be found for the requested type using
                either resolution strategy.

        Performance:
            Provider lookup is cached using functools.cache. The first resolution
            of a type performs a full lookup; subsequent resolutions use the cached
            provider. The provider itself is invoked on every call, respecting its
            configured scope (Factory creates new instances, Singleton reuses one).

        Example:

        Traversal Process:

            2. Builds the current path by appending provider name to parent path
            3. For Container providers: recursively traverses the nested container
            4. For class-based providers (Factory, Singleton, etc.): records the
               mapping from type to path

        Provider Types Mapped:
            - Factory, Singleton, Callable, Coroutine providers with a 'cls' attribute

        Find and return the provider for a requested type with caching.

        This method implements the two-strategy resolution algorithm that enables
        both direct type lookup and inheritance-based resolution. Results are
        cached permanently using functools.cache for maximum performance.

        Resolution Algorithm:
            Strategy 1 - Exact Type Match (O(1) lookup):
                Checks if the requested type exists directly in the type-to-provider map.
                This handles cases where the exact type was registered in the container.

            Strategy 2 - Inheritance-Based Match (O(n) scan):
                If no exact match, iterates through all registered types to find one
                that is a subclass of the requested type. This enables:
                - Resolving abstract base classes to concrete implementations
                - Resolving interfaces to their implementations
                - Programming to abstractions instead of concretions

        Args:
            requested_type: The type to find a provider for. Can be concrete or abstract.

        Returns:
            The provider that can instantiate the requested type. The provider will
            be invoked by the caller (typically resolve()) to create instances.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If neither resolution strategy finds a suitable provider.
                This typically means the type was not registered in the container.

        Caching Behavior:
            This method is decorated with @functools.cache, which means:
            - First call for a type performs the full lookup algorithm
            - Subsequent calls for the same type return the cached provider instantly
            - Cache persists for the lifetime of the container instance
            - Cache is cleared when attach_external_container() is called

        Performance Characteristics:
            - Exact match: O(1) dictionary lookup
            - Inheritance match: O(n) where n = number of registered types
            - Cached retrieval: O(1) after first lookup
            - Memory: O(k) where k = number of unique types resolved

        Examples:
            >>> # Exact match
            >>> provider = container._get_provider(UserService)  # Fast O(1)
            >>>
            >>> # Inheritance match (first time)

            >>> # Same call (cached)
            >>> provider = container._get_provider(IUserService)  # Fast O(1)

        Note:
            When inheritance matching finds multiple subclasses, it returns the
            first one encountered in the dictionary iteration. For predictable
            behavior, avoid registering multiple implementations of the same interface.
