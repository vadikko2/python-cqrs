    The event handler interface.

    Subclasses must implement :meth:`handle`. Optionally override :attr:`events`
    to return follow-up events emitted after handling (e.g. for multi-level
    event chains).

    Example::

        class UserJoinedEvent(DomainEvent):
            meeting_id: str
            user_id: str

        class UserJoinedEventHandler(EventHandler[UserJoinedEvent]):
